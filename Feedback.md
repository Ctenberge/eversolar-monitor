# Feedback please! #

We have had over 100 downloads of the Raspberry Image, and very little feedback. Either things are fine, or people give up.

In the box below you can share your feedback. This will enable us to develop the solution - and it will thell the other interested parties, if this is a solution they have a chance of success with.

So, what have you set up, did it work, and were there any obstacles?
