Wiki about Eversolar perl logger

# Introduction #

The software is mainly documented in the code, this wiki is more focused on how to set up the hardware, supported software and interesting facts for anyone wanting to build a cheap monitoring system


# Details #

Current typical setup is a Raspberry Pi, one USB to RS485 port connected to one or two Eversolar inverters. There are people using ethernet to RS485 adapters, RS422 adapters and desktop pc's or NAS boxes. Anything goes, but remember to consider the power consumption, this solution is going to be working 24x7x365, so the power saved by using a light system may pay off within a year or two.
